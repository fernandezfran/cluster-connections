# example
To make the calculations in the example, run the bash script `run.sh`:
```bash
bash run.sh
```
This script has a first part of compilation, then the execution of the program 
that performs the clustering analysis and writes a csv file with the different 
partial components to the RDF. Finally, a python script does the plot.
